# Inventory System in Go
This inventory system project originated from a real-world need within my professional environment. Out of personal interest and a desire to improve my technical skills, I decided to build a similar system using the technologies I’m currently studying. In this version, the backend will be developed in Go.

# Problem Statement
Initially, the system was proposed to address inventory management issues in the production department. While a simple Excel spreadsheet could solve the problem, the goal of this project is to provide a more user-friendly and visual interface—making it accessible to anyone without prior technical knowledge.

# Technologies Used
- Go (Golang) – for building the backend API
- PostgreSQL – as the relational database
- Docker – for containerization and easier deployment

### Note:
These technologies were chosen based on personal preference and learning goals, not necessarily because they are the "best" tools for the job. The main objective is to create a functional, scalable, and environment-agnostic system that can be used in both personal and professional contexts.

# User Interface
The initial focus will be on developing the backend. More updates regarding the UI will be shared soon.
